# Sorting Visualizations

I'm working on simple visualizations of all the fundamental sorting algorithims.

If you're interested in running the code on your own, make sure to download [Processing](https://www.processing.org) and use the Python module to run the .pyde file. Try playing with some of the variables at the top of the script to get a feel for how they affect the terrain generation.

Feel free to email me at thebuffed@gmail.com if you have any questions.
